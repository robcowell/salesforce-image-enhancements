# Salesforce Image Enhancements - DEMO PROJECT Only

This project is based on work I've previously done, but probably isn't in a "drop into my org and it just works" state.

It's intended to be used for my TDX 2024 session on unlocked packages, and so is structured to show multiple packages,
with dependencies and configs and things.

I make no promises that this will solve image handling in Field Service for you, as it stands.
